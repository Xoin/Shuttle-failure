=============== Shuttle-failure ===============

Shuttle failure is a small game created in LÖVE for Ludum Dare 28. It comes as no suprise that its
probabl really bad (just like my spelling) but I did have fun with it. The controles are not that
hard.


Its probably good to remind that this is my first game in years and my knowledge of LÖVE is probably
entirely gained while doing this in the 48 hour timespan Ludum Dare gives you. So expect it to be
horribly optimised.


Controls:

Enter to skip dialog or confirm an option.

Up and down arrows to change the selection.

Escape to sto playing.

If you for any reason have problems correctly reading the letters (because their small), I highly
advise using the magnifiging glass that comes with pretty much any Windows version.
